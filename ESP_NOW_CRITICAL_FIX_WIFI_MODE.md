# ESP-NOW Critical Fix: WiFi Mode Issue

## Critical Issue Found

**Problem**: ESP-NOW was not receiving any data from the transmitter despite successful initialization.

**Root Cause**: The WiFi mode was set to `WIFI_AP` instead of `WIFI_MODE_APSTA` in AP mode, which prevented ESP-NOW from functioning correctly.

## The Fix

### **Changed WiFi Mode for AP Mode**

**Before** (Not Working):
```cpp
WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP);
```

**After** (Working - from commit cbddef9d417e6c26dbcde2af81b81a68f1a8f2c8):
```cpp
WiFi.mode(WIFI_MODE_APSTA);
```

## Why This Matters

ESP-NOW requires both AP and STA capabilities to function properly. When WiFi is set to `WIFI_AP` only, ESP-NOW cannot operate correctly because it needs the STA (Station) mode capabilities to send and receive ESP-NOW packets.

The working commit used `WIFI_MODE_APSTA` which enables **both Access Point and Station modes simultaneously**, allowing:
1. The device to act as an Access Point for web interface access
2. ESP-NOW to use the Station mode capabilities for peer-to-peer communication

## Summary of All Changes Applied

1. **Restored Simple ESP-NOW Initialization** (from working commit):
   - Simple `esp_now_init()` + `esp_now_register_recv_cb()`
   - No complex peer configuration
   - No WiFi mode changes in ESP-NOW task

2. **Restored Simple OnDataRecv Callback** (from working commit):
   - Basic data copying and printing
   - No complex validation or debugging

3. **Updated Task Name** (from working commit):
   - Changed from "SensorsESPNOW" to "Task2"

4. **Fixed Critical WiFi Mode Issue** (from working commit):
   - Changed AP mode from `WIFI_AP` to `WIFI_MODE_APSTA`

## Expected Behavior Now

### **Initialization**:
```
Task2 running on core 1
ESP Now Initiated Successfully.
WiFi Mode: STA (or AP with APSTA capabilities)
```

### **Data Reception** (Should work now):
```
Bytes received: 10
sensorA: 1
sensorB: 1
valueA: 255
valueB: 753

Wifi Strength: -45
```

## Files Modified

1. **`arduino-example/smart_tank_esp32/smart_tank_esp32.ino`**:
   - Line ~2513: Changed `WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP)` to `WiFi.mode(WIFI_MODE_APSTA)`
   - Restored simple ESP-NOW initialization from working commit
   - Restored simple OnDataRecv callback from working commit

## Next Steps

1. **Compile and upload** the updated firmware
2. **Test with transmitter** (MAC: 08:D1:F9:A6:DE:6C)
3. **Verify data reception** in Serial Monitor

The ESP-NOW should now work correctly with the proper WiFi mode configuration!
