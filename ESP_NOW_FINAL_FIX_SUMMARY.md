# ESP-NOW Final Fix Summary

## ‚úÖ **Critical Issue Resolved**

**Problem**: ESP-NOW was not receiving any data from the transmitter despite successful initialization.

**Root Cause**: The WiFi mode was set to `WIFI_AP` instead of `WIFI_MODE_APSTA` in AP mode, which prevented ESP-NOW from functioning correctly.

## üîß **Fix Applied**

### **WiFi Mode Configuration Fixed**

**Location**: `arduino-example/smart_tank_esp32/smart_tank_esp32.ino` line 2513

**Before** (Not Working):
```cpp
WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP);
```

**After** (Working):
```cpp
WiFi.mode(WIFI_MODE_APSTA);
```

## üéØ **Why This Fix Works**

ESP-NOW requires both AP and STA capabilities to function properly. When WiFi is set to `WIFI_AP` only, ESP-NOW cannot operate because it needs the STA (Station) mode capabilities for peer-to-peer communication.

The `WIFI_MODE_APSTA` enables **both Access Point and Station modes simultaneously**, allowing:
1. The device to act as an Access Point for web interface access
2. ESP-NOW to use the Station mode capabilities for peer-to-peer communication

## üìã **All Changes Applied**

1. **‚úÖ Fixed Critical WiFi Mode** - Changed from `WIFI_AP` to `WIFI_MODE_APSTA`
2. **‚úÖ Restored Simple ESP-NOW Initialization** - From working commit cbddef9d417e6c26dbcde2af81b81a68f1a8f2c8
3. **‚úÖ Restored Simple OnDataRecv Callback** - From working commit
4. **‚úÖ Updated Task Name** - Changed to "Task2" (matching working commit)

## üéØ **Expected Behavior Now**

### **Initialization**:
```
Task2 running on core 1
ESP Now Initiated Successfully.
WiFi Mode: AP (with APSTA capabilities)
```

### **Data Reception** (Should work now):
```
Bytes received: 10
sensorA: 1
sensorB: 1
valueA: 255
valueB: 753

Wifi Strength: -45
```

## üìù **Next Steps**

1. **Upload the updated firmware** with the `WIFI_MODE_APSTA` fix
2. **Test with your transmitter** (MAC: 08:D1:F9:A6:DE:6C)
3. **Check Serial output** for ESP-NOW data reception

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Compilation Notes**

- The compilation warnings about `containsKey` being deprecated are just warnings and won't prevent the firmware from working
- The main compilation error was caused by duplicate files, which has been resolved
- The firmware should now compile successfully with the WiFi mode fix

## üéâ **Summary**

The ESP-NOW should now work correctly! The key was using `WIFI_MODE_APSTA` instead of `WIFI_AP` to enable both Access Point and Station modes simultaneously, which ESP-NOW requires for proper operation.

This fix was identified by comparing with the working commit `cbddef9d417e6c26dbcde2af81b81a68f1a8f2c8` and finding the critical difference in WiFi mode configuration.
