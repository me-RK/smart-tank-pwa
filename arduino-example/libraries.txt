# Required Libraries for Smart Tank ESP32 Code

Install these libraries through Arduino IDE Library Manager:

## Core Libraries
1. **WebSockets** by Markus Sattler
   - Version: 2.3.6 or later
   - Used for: WebSocket server communication with PWA app
   - Installation: Tools → Manage Libraries → Search "WebSockets"

2. **ArduinoJson** by Benoit Blanchon
   - Version: 6.21.0 or later
   - Used for: JSON parsing and generation
   - Installation: Tools → Manage Libraries → Search "ArduinoJson"

## ESP32 Built-in Libraries
These are included with ESP32 core and don't need separate installation:

- **WiFi** - WiFi connectivity
- **Preferences** - Non-volatile storage
- **FreeRTOS** - Task management (xTaskCreatePinnedToCore)

## Installation Steps

1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Go to Tools → Manage Libraries
3. Search for each library name
4. Click Install for the correct library
5. Restart Arduino IDE after installation

## Alternative Installation (GitHub)

If Library Manager doesn't work, you can install manually:

### WebSockets Library
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Links2004/WebSockets.git
# Copy to Arduino/libraries/WebSockets/
```

### ArduinoJson Library
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson.git
# Copy to Arduino/libraries/ArduinoJson/
```

## Verification

After installation, verify libraries are available:
1. Go to Sketch → Include Library
2. Check that "WebSockets" and "ArduinoJson" appear in the list
3. Try compiling the sketch to ensure no missing library errors
